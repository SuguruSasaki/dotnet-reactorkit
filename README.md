# .Net Reactorkit 

This is C # version of Reactorkit. 

Original code is [swift](https://github.com/ReactorKit/ReactorKit)  
I love ReactorKit in swift :)

## Concept
ReactorKit is a combination of Flux and Reactive Programming. 
The user actions and the view states are delivered to each layer via observable streams.
These streams are unidirectional: the view can only emit actions and the reactor can only emit states.
